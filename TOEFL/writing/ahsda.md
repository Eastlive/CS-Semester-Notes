- I strongly agree with Kelly's point of view that teachers should give grades to students only based on their performance in their work. It is because that learning is only about the result, not about the process.（避免绝对） What students need to understand （is that） the purpose of study is acquiring knowledge, not pursuing **a hard work appearance**（解释appearance）(For example...). From my observation, there are so many students pursuing the length of the study period and the richness of notes. However, these kinds of hard work cannot help them comprehend knowledge better, and therefore cannot improve their performance in their work. If teachers give them higher scores, students will be misled that pretending to show effort is more important than making sense. As a result, students will spend more energy on show their working appearance, rather than learning knowledge, which is undesirable. On the contrary, if teachers only care about the performance of students, that can encourage students to figure out better ways of study, which can promote learning efficiency, and make progress in their academic performance.

- With the ~~growing~~ **serious** press on our environment, the ~~growing temperature~~ **climate change / global warming** has been a global environment problem. **T**emperature in many places over the world has hit the maximum record and cause**d** many **death** ~~people die~~. In order to solve this problem, I think we should reduce using fuel and find a new energy source. The temperature growing mainly causes by carbon dioxide polluting, and burning fuel will create innumerable CO2. Therefore, we should find a new resource of ~~our~~ energy to ~~reducing~~ **reduce** polluting greenhouse gas. For example, we can make full use of the solar energy, it is not only **an** environment friendly method, ~~but it also too mush to use up~~ **the resource is innumerable**. What's more, using solar energy can absorb heat from the sun, which can also lessen the temperature of the earth. In conclusion, we should find a new energy source like solar energy instead of using fuel, which will help to solve the problem of the growing temperature.
