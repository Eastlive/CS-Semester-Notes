1. 社交媒体允许我们对生活进行编辑，我们的照片，信息都可以被编辑。例如，当我们选择照片的时候，我们会留下最好的照片，而删除不好的照片。这表明我们在对过去的生活做出编辑，让它变得更符合我们的期望。更进一步，我们可以在社交媒体上通过编辑从而让我们的生活完全变成另一幅模样，这样的做法给了我们一个机会去重新定义我们的生活，去创造更多的可能性。

2. 社交媒体可以给我们正向的鼓励。当我们在社交媒体上收到赞和积极的评论时，我们会感到开心。不仅如此，我们还会因为这些正向的鼓励而得到积极的反馈，从而对自己的生活更加有了信心和动力。这些回应被称为正强化（positive reinforcement）。正强化指的是当一个行为被赞赏时，这个行为就会被加强。这种正强化的机制不仅可以给我们好的感受，告诉你这个世界上还有很多人喜欢你、羡慕你，你并不孤单，而且能让我们提升自我价值，给我们继续前进的动力。

Mass media and new media have brought a fresh burst of energy and influence to modern society, with positive impacts felt in various ways.

Firstly, looking at **setting the agenda**, mass media and new media play a significant role in guiding public opinion. Amidst a sea of information, the media has the power to decide which events get attention and which don't. When an issue gets widely covered by mainstream media, it often quickly becomes the talk of the town. This ability of the media to set topics means they're not just about sharing news but also shaping societal beliefs. Just think about big recent events like climate change or the COVID outbreak; media coverage made them central topics, influencing how people act and feel.

Next, from the perspective of **ideology dissemination and critical thinking**, mass media and new media act as a double-edged sword. They can both introduce a particular viewpoint and give a platform to diverse voices. Traditional media tends to push a single narrative, but new channels like social networks offer a stage to all kinds of opinions. This variety encourages people to see things from different angles, fostering public critical thinking, and sometimes even challenging established social beliefs, driving societal change.

Lastly, from the **checks and balances** angle, mass and new media showcase their unique value. Media's role in overseeing and revealing often leads to wrong actions being corrected. For instance, if there's an issue with a policy or rule, media coverage helps the public know about it and push for adjustments. This cycle of "media exposure–public attention–correction" is now a regular thing. The media also works to make society more transparent, bridging the information gap between the government and the public, upholding the rule of law.

Considering these points, here's the **conclusion**: mass media and new media are not only news sharers but also catalysts for societal change, playing an indispensable role in shaping public views, fostering societal advancement, and preserving social justice.
