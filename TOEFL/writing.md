- I strongly agree with Kelly's point of view that teachers should give grades to students only based on their performance in their work. It is because that learning is only about the result, not about the process. What students need to understand the purpose of study is acquiring knowledge, not pursuing a hard work appearance. From my observation, there are so many students pursuing the length of the study period and the richness of notes. However, these kinds of hard work cannot help them comprehend knowledge better, and therefore cannot improve their performance in their work. If teachers give them higher scores, students will be misled that pretending to show effort is more important than making sense. As a result, students will spend more energy on show their working appearance, rather than learning knowledge, which is undesirable. On the contrary, if teachers only care about the performance of students, that can encourage students to figure out better ways of study, which can promote learning efficiency, and make progress in their academic performance.

### 范文

- I strongly agree with Kelly's point of view that teachers should give students grades based on their work performance, not on their effort. Because learning is about results, not about process. Students should understand that the purpose of learning is to acquire knowledge, not to pursue the hard work of learning. From my observation, many students now pursue the length of learning and the richness of notes. But these efforts do not allow them to better acquire knowledge, and therefore do not give them higher work performance. If teachers give these students higher scores, students will think that performance is more important than learning knowledge. The result is that students will pay more attention to their performance rather than learning knowledge, which is undesirable. On the contrary, if teachers only pay attention to students' performance, it will promote students to find better learning methods, thereby improving learning efficiency and academic performance.

1. 审题：one global environmental problem, and find a solution。

## 英文写作

- With the growing press on our environment, the growing temperature has been a global environment problem. temperature in many places over the world has hit the maximum record and cause many people die. In order to solve this problem, I think we should reduce using fuel and find a new energy source. The temperature growing mainly causes by carbon dioxide polluting, and burning fuel will create innumerable CO2. Therefore, we should find a new resource of our energy to reducing polluting greenhouse gas. For example, we can make full use of the solar energy, it is not only environment friendly method, but it also too mush to use up. What's more, using solar energy can absorb heat from the sun, which can also lessen the temperature of the earth. In conclusion, we should find a new energy source like solar energy instead of using fuel, which will help to solve the problem of the growing temperature.
